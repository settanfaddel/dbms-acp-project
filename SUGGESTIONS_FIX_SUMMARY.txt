# ✅ SUGGESTIONS TAB - FIXED AND WORKING

## What Was Wrong
The Suggestions links in `index.html` (home page) were pointing to `#` (anchor) instead of `/suggestions` (actual route). This caused the URL to show `http://192.168.1.107:5000/#` instead of navigating to the suggestions page.

## What Was Fixed
- ✅ Desktop navbar Suggestions link: `#` → `/suggestions`
- ✅ Mobile menu Suggestions link: `#` → `/suggestions`  
- ✅ Added lightbulb icon to match other pages
- ✅ Verified all 3 suggestion routes are registered and working

## All Suggestions Routes Active
```
✓ GET  /suggestions              - View all suggestions
✓ POST /submit-suggestion        - Submit new suggestion
✓ POST /update-suggestion/<id>   - Update suggestion status (admin only)
```
